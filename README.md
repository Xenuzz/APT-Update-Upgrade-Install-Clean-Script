# APT-Update-Upgrade-Install-Clean-Script
Hello people, here is a small update/upgrade/clean script with a query

Simply run the script via Terminal sudo bash update.bh

Don't forget you have to go to the right directory, so if you just want to download it and start it then just in the terminal "cd Downloads && sudo bash update.bh" input

Have a nice day everyone
